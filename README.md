Basics & Duplicate Code

function is main

variable usages:
s := "" < short declaration & compact
var s string default initialization with zero value
var s = "" < Rarely used except declaring multiple var
var s string = "" < redundant but ncessary in other cases where they are not of the same type


### Maps
A map is a reference to the data structure created by make. When a map is passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the reference, so any changes the called function makes to the underlying data structure will be visible through the callerâ€™s map reference too.
In our example, the values inserted into the counts map by countLines are seen by main.



### Loops
for initialization; condition; post {
    // zero or more statements
}

// traditional while loop
for condition {
  // ...
}

// traditional infinite loop
for {
  // ...
}

### Make
make for the most part is allocation of memory to the buffer

### Channels
A communication mechanism
- Create a new channel with make(chan val-type)
- Send a value into a channel using the channel <- syntax
- The <-channel syntax receivs a value from the channel

### Go routines
goroutine, concurrent function execution. Channels are important in goroutne's

### Printf verb tables
%d          decimal integer
%x, %o, %b  integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary
%f, %g, %e  floating-point number
%t          boolean: true or false
%c          rune (Unicode code point)
%s          string
%q          quoted string "abc" or rune 'c'
%v          any value in a natural format
%T          type of any value
%%          literal percent sign (no operand)

## Lessons

### Lissajous
- const declaration is unchangeable
- The expressions []color.Color{...} and gif.GIF{...} are composite literals, a compact notation for instantiating any of Go's composite types from a sequence of element values. Here, the first one is a slice and the second one is a struct.

### Fetch
- new two package introduction, net/http and io/ioutl.
- io.ReadAll reads the entire response, and it is stored in b.
- Body stream should be closed to avoid leaking resources
- Lastly, Printf writes th response to the standard output. First it was bytes but I converted it to strings via strings().

### Fetching URLs Concurrently
goroutine is a concurrent function execution. A channel is a communication mechanism that allow one goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutine. The function main runs in a goroutine and the go statement creates additional goroutines.
Each fetch sends a value (ch <- expression) on the channel ch, and main receives all of them (<-ch). Having main do all the printing ensures that output from each goroutine is processed as a unit, no danger of interleaving if two goroutines finish at the same time
- Exercise 
  - 1.10 - was able to print the output to a file and facebook and google were always consistent. Something to note is the internet speed and if google and facebook has special cashing for any requests
  - 1.11 - program broke after adding a new site that returns a 404 but accidentally left a '/' in the url and this was also the last argument. I suspect that there's something happening in the channels that a simple '/' broke the response second output. Must see in Section 8.9 for coping outputs
  - 1.11 - IN ERRATUM - it was because the io.Copy was being executed before the lesson's own io.Copy thus making the bytes seem none.

### Web Server
Race condition is avoided via mu.Lock() (sync.Mutex)
ParseForm is nested within an if statement. This allows a local variable declaration that precedes the if condition.

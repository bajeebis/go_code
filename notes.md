Basics & Duplicate Code

function is main

variable usages:
s := "" < short declaration & compact
var s string default initialization with zero value
var s = "" < Rarely used except declaring multiple var
var s string = "" < redundant but ncessary in other cases where they are not of the same type


## Maps
A map is a reference to the data structure created by make. When a map is passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the reference, so any changes the called function makes to the underlying data structure will be visible through the callerâ€™s map reference too.
In our example, the values inserted into the counts map by countLines are seen by main.



## Loops
for initialization; condition; post {
    // zero or more statements
}

// traditional while loop
for condition {
  // ...
}

// traditional infinite loop
for {
  // ...
}

## Make
make for the most part is allocation of memory to the buffer

## Printf verb tables
%d          decimal integer
%x, %o, %b  integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary
%f, %g, %e  floating-point number
%t          boolean: true or false
%c          rune (Unicode code point)
%s          string
%q          quoted string "abc" or rune 'c'
%v          any value in a natural format
%T          type of any value
%%          literal percent sign (no operand)

## Lessons

### Lissajous
- const declaration is unchangeable
- The expressions []color.Color{...} and gif.GIF{...} are composite literals, a compact notation for instantiating any of Go's composite types from a sequence of element values. Here, the first one is a slice and the second one is a struct.

### Fetch
- new two package introduction, net/http and io/ioutl.
- io.ReadAll reads the entire response, and it is stored in b.
- Body stream should be closed to avoid leaking resources
- Lastly, Printf writes th response to the standard output. First it was bytes but I converted it to strings via strings().

### Fetching URLs Concurrently
- goroutine is a concurrent function execution. A channel is a communication mechanism that allow one goroutine to pass values of a specified type to another goroutine. The function main runs in a goroutine and the go statement creates additional goroutines.

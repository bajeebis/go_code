function is main

variable usages:
s := "" < short declaration & compact
var s string default initialization with zero value
var s = "" < Rarely used except declaring multiple var
var s string = "" < redundant but ncessary in other cases where they are not of the same type


## Maps
A map is a reference to the data structure create d by make. When a map is passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the reference, so any changes the called function makes to the underlying data structure will be visible through the callerâ€™s map reference too.
In our example, the values inserted into the counts map by countLines are seen by main.



## Loops
for initialization; condition; post {
    // zero or more statements
}

// traditional while loop
for condition {
  // ...
}

// traditional infinite loop
for {
  // ...
}
